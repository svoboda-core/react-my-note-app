# My note 

* This is a simple application for taking your notes.
* You can add or remove a note in it.
* Search and sort notes.
* The application can switch between dark and light.
* Application design adaptive to different screens

## Fast start:
* Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/react-my-note-app`
* Go to the project folder: `cd react-my-note-app`
* Run command `npm install` to install dependencies
* In the project directory, you can run: `npm start`<br /> (Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser)
* In the project directory, you can also run: `npm build`<br /> (Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!)
